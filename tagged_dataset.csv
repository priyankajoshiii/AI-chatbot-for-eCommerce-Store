"I am male 64 yo.  While visiting my dermatologist for something else, I asked which one of those expensive creams on the market are best to empty pores and reduce wrinkles.

Pores are not emptying as fast as I like, but notice the brown spots greatly reduced.  Noticed this product from Amazon, ordered a few and using in place of doctor's cream for now.Nice thing about doctor's formula, is it has sunblock spf40.Anyone know if this Alpha HydroxAHA is similar to doctor recommended HydroxyAlpha12% cream?

I am debating if I should keep this or return it. Hope I haven't received a cheap imitation. The ceramic plates also have a tiny scratch. Is this not a big deal?

"CHI 2 inch flat iron- made in korea?? Hi,I just received my CHI turbo 2 inch flat iron I ordered on amazon.com - It says made in korea and the accompanying instruction booklet is full of typos. I haven't tried the flat iron yet, but when I took it out of the box, gently, I heard a shifting, moving sound, like some part was loose inside. On a quick glance everything seems okay. I am debating if I should keep this or return it. Hope I haven't received a cheap imitation. The ceramic plates also have a tiny scratch. Is this not a big deal?
